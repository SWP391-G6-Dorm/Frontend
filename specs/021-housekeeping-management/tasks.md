# Tasks: FR-21 Housekeeping Management

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/021-housekeeping-management/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/housekeeping-api.yaml, quickstart.md

**Phụ thuộc**: FR-04 (checkout hook); FR-08 (room status); FR-20 (employee property assignment); FR-06 (Manager property scope); FR-12/FR-23 (checkout preconditions upstream). **Ranh giới**: FR-22 Dashboard counts; FR-13 Maintenance; Admin housekeeping read-only.

**Tests**: Không có phase test riêng per-story. Unit + integration trong Phase Polish per plan Phase I.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story (US1–US6) for independent delivery.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no blocking deps)
- **[Story]**: US1–US6 maps to spec.md user stories

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/`
- **Backend tests**: `backend/src/test/java/com/homestay/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Migrations**: `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- **Contract**: `specs/021-housekeeping-management/contracts/housekeeping-api.yaml`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Blockers, V037 migration, dev proxy

- [ ] T001 Verify FR-01 JWT auth with **MANAGER** and **EMPLOYEE** roles per `specs/001-user-auth/quickstart.md` (blocker)
- [ ] T002 Verify FR-06 property scope, FR-08 rooms, FR-20 employee assignments per respective quickstarts (blocker)
- [ ] T003 Create Flyway `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V037__housekeeping_tasks_fr21.sql` — table `housekeeping_tasks`, indexes, `uq_hk_booking_active` per `data-model.md`
- [ ] T004 [P] Confirm Vite proxy `/api/v1` → backend in `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- [ ] T005 [P] Add dev seed SQL comments in V037 — sample PENDING task + checked-out booking reference for local demo

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [ ] T008 [P] Create `HousekeepingTaskRepository.java` in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/repositories/HousekeepingTaskRepository.java` — `findByPropertyIdAndStatus`, `findByAssignedEmployeeIdAndStatus`, `existsActiveByBookingId`, `findOpenByRoomId`
- [ ] T009 [P] Create `HousekeepingTaskResponse.java` in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/dtos/housekeeping/HousekeepingTaskResponse.java`

- [ ] T013 [P] Create `CancelHousekeepingTaskRequest.java` in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/dtos/housekeeping/CancelHousekeepingTaskRequest.java`
- [ ] T014 Create `HousekeepingTaskService.java` skeleton in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/services/HousekeepingTaskService.java` — inject repos, RoomRepository, PropertyScopeService
- [ ] T015 Create `RoomStatusGuardService.java` skeleton in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/services/RoomStatusGuardService.java` — `assertCanSetAvailable(roomId)`
- [ ] T016 Register `hasRole('MANAGER')` for `/api/v1/manager/housekeeping-tasks/**`, `hasRole('EMPLOYEE')` for `/api/v1/employee/housekeeping-tasks/**`, `hasRole('ADMIN')` GET-only for `/api/v1/admin/housekeeping-tasks` in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/configs/SecurityConfig.java`
- [ ] T017 [P] Create `housekeepingApi.ts` skeleton in `frontend/src/api/housekeepingApi.ts` — typed methods per `contracts/housekeeping-api.yaml`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — user story implementation can begin

**Goal**: Auto-create PENDING HousekeepingTask + room Pending Cleaning on booking Checked-out (idempotent)

**Independent Test**: After valid checkout, one PENDING task exists per booking; room Pending Cleaning; no duplicate on retry

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Manager gán Employee / tạo task thủ công (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Employee starts task → IN_PROGRESS + room Cleaning In Progress

**Independent Test**: Employee PATCH IN_PROGRESS on assigned task; room sync; non-assignee 403

**Checkpoint**: US4 testable — employee start flow on SCR-60

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 — Employee hoàn thành + chặn bypass Available (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Complete task → room Available; block Manager manual Available bypass

**Independent Test**: Employee COMPLETED → room Available; Manager manual Available with open task rejected

### Implementation

- [ ] T060 [US6] Reject cancel on COMPLETED tasks in `HousekeepingTaskService.java`

**Checkpoint**: US6 testable — cancel + history filter

---

## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: After FR-01, FR-06, FR-08, FR-20 blockers
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup — **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **US1 (P1)**: After Foundational — **MVP** auto-create hook
- **US2 (P1)**: After Foundational — list UI (can parallel US1 backend)
- **US3 (P1)**: After US2 (board page exists)
- **US4 (P1)**: After US3 (tasks can be assigned)
- **US5 (P1)**: After US4 (start before complete)
- **US6 (P2)**: After US2–US5 stable
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: After desired user stories

### User Story Dependencies

```text
Foundational → US1 (auto-create hook) — MVP backend
            → US2 (Manager board + Admin read)
            → US3 (assign + create)
            → US4 (employee start)
            → US5 (employee complete + bypass guard)
            → US6 (cancel + history)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1**: T004, T005 [P]  
**Phase 2** (after T014): T006–T013, T017 all [P]  
**US1 + US2**: T023–T025 backend parallel with T018–T020 after Foundational  
**US3**: T037 parallel with T033–T036  
**US4**: T045 parallel with T041–T044  
**Polish**: T061, T062, T064, T065, T067, T068 all [P]

### Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
T023–T025 Backend list + Manager/Admin controllers
T026 housekeepingApi list methods (parallel)
T027–T032 HousekeepingTasksPage + route + nav
```

### Parallel Example: Foundational

```bash
T006–T013 Entity, enum, repo, DTOs (all parallel)
T014–T015 Service skeletons
T016 SecurityConfig
T017 housekeepingApi.ts skeleton
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + US2 list)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001–T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006–T017)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T018–T022) — auto-create hook
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T023–T032) — Manager board
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Checkout creates task visible on SCR-40

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. US1 → Auto task on checkout (MVP backend)
3. US2 → Manager board (MVP UI)
4. US3 → Assign + manual create
5. US4 → Employee start
6. US5 → Employee complete + bypass guard
7. US6 → Cancel + history
8. Polish → Tests + quickstart

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational:

- **Developer A**: US1 + US2 (auto-create + Manager board)
- **Developer B**: US3 + US4 (assign + employee start)
- **Developer C**: US5 + US6 (complete + cancel/guard)

---

## Notes

- FR-04 checkout hook is integration point — stub with direct service call in tests if FR-04 incomplete
- Employee layout may not exist — create minimal `EmployeeLayout.tsx` in T068
- Strict transitions enforced in service — no PENDING→COMPLETED shortcut
- Admin has GET-only — no assign/cancel on admin routes
- FR-22 Dashboard consumes counts — out of scope; expose list endpoint only
