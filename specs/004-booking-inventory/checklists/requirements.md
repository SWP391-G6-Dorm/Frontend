# Specification Quality Checklist: FR-04 Booking & Inventory Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-06-27  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 (2026-06-27): **16/16 pass**. Spec ready for `/speckit-plan`.
- Hold timeout documented as 30 minutes default in Assumptions (FR-04 primary source); api-spec-by-screen mentions 15-minute VNPay cron — reconcile during planning if needed.
- Contract generation, payment reconciliation, inspection dispute, and housekeeping execution explicitly bounded to FR-10, FR-11/12, FR-23, FR-21.
