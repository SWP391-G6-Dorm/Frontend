# Tasks: FR-22 Employee Dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/022-employee-dashboard/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/employee-dashboard-api.yaml, quickstart.md

**Phụ thuộc**: FR-01 (EMPLOYEE JWT + fullName); FR-20 (employee property assignments); FR-21 (housekeeping_tasks); FR-13 (maintenance_tickets); FR-23/FR-04 (room_inspections + booking check_out). **Ranh giới**: FR-22 owns composite `GET /api/v1/employee/dashboard` + SCR-59 UI; không bảng mới; không status updates (SCR-60/61/62).

**Tests**: Không có phase test riêng per-story. Unit + integration trong Phase Polish per plan Phase F.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story (US1–US6) for independent delivery.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no blocking deps)
- **[Story]**: US1–US6 maps to spec.md user stories

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/`
- **Backend tests**: `backend/src/test/java/com/homestay/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Migrations**: `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- **Contract**: `specs/022-employee-dashboard/contracts/employee-dashboard-api.yaml`

- [ ] T014 [P] Add dashboard count/preview query methods to `RoomInspectionRepository.java` in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/repositories/RoomInspectionRepository.java`
- [ ] T015 Create `EmployeeDashboardService.java` skeleton in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/services/EmployeeDashboardService.java` — inject repos + `EmployeePropertyAssignmentRepository`; `resolveAssignedPropertyIds(employeeId)`
- [ ] T016 Create `EmployeeDashboardController.java` skeleton in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/controllers/EmployeeDashboardController.java`
- [ ] T017 Register `hasRole('EMPLOYEE')` for `/api/v1/employee/dashboard` and `/api/v1/employee/kpis` in `backend/src/main/java/com/homestay/configs/SecurityConfig.java`

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Danh sách Housekeeping được gán (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Preview list max 5 assigned housekeeping tasks (Pending + In Progress)

**Independent Test**: Employee with 3 HK tasks → dashboard `housekeepingTasks` length 3 with room + status; empty state when none

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Danh sách Maintenance được gán (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Preview list max 5 assigned maintenance tickets (Assigned + In Progress)

**Independent Test**: Employee with Assigned ticket → `maintenanceTickets` preview shows title + room; click Maintenance card → SCR-61

### Implementation

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 — Tác vụ trong ngày hôm nay (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Unified `todayTasks` section (max 10) with type labels

**Independent Test**: Inspection with booking check_out today → appears in `todayTasks` with type INSPECTION

### Implementation

- [ ] T040 [US4] Implement `listTodayTasks(employeeId, propertyIds, limit=10)` — union HK/MT/RI per `research.md` §5 with `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` today filter in `EmployeeDashboardService.java`

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 — Đang chờ vs đã hoàn thành hôm nay (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: `awaiting` and `completedToday` summaries with counts + previews (max 3 per type)

**Independent Test**: Employee completes HK today → `completedToday.housekeepingCount` increments; yesterday completions excluded

### Implementation

- [ ] T045 [US5] Implement `buildAwaitingSummary(employeeId, propertyIds)` with counts + previews max 3/type in `EmployeeDashboardService.java`

**Checkpoint**: US6 testable — inspection preview + no-property empty state

---

## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Tests, quickstart validation, read-only guard

- [ ] T057 [P] Unit test KPI counts match repository data in `backend/src/test/java/com/homestay/unit/EmployeeDashboardServiceTest.java`
- [ ] T058 [P] Unit test today filter and completed-today scope in `EmployeeDashboardServiceTest.java`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: After FR-01, FR-20, FR-21, FR-13, FR-23 blockers
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup — **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **US1 (P1)**: After Foundational — **MVP** KPI + action cards
- **US2–US6 (P1)**: After US1 backend `getDashboard()` exists; UI sections can incrementally wire
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: After desired user stories

### User Story Dependencies

```text
Foundational → US1 (KPI + greeting + action cards) — MVP
            → US2 (housekeeping preview)
            → US3 (maintenance preview)
            → US4 (today tasks)
            → US5 (awaiting vs completed today)
            → US6 (inspection preview + no-property state)
```

US2–US6 backend methods can be implemented in parallel after Foundational; each extends `getDashboard()` response.

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1**: T003, T004, T005 [P]  
**Phase 2** (after T015): T006–T014, T018 all [P]  
**US1**: T023 parallel with T019–T022  
**US2 + US3**: T029–T030 parallel with T035–T036 after US1 service base  
**Polish**: T057, T058, T060, T061, T063, T064 all [P]

### Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
T019–T022 Backend KPI counts + controller endpoints
T023 employeeDashboardApi.ts (parallel)
T024–T028 EmployeeLayout + EmployeeDashboardPage + route
```

### Parallel Example: Foundational

```bash
T006–T011 All DTOs (parallel)
T012–T014 Repository query methods (parallel)
T015–T017 Service + controller + security
T018 API client types
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001–T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006–T018)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019–T028)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Employee sees KPI dashboard via `quickstart.md` curl + UI

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. US1 → KPI + action cards (MVP)
3. US2 → Housekeeping preview
4. US3 → Maintenance preview
5. US4 → Today tasks
6. US5 → Awaiting vs completed
7. US6 → Inspection preview + no-property state
8. Polish → Tests + quickstart

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational:

- **Developer A**: US1 + US2 (KPI shell + housekeeping)
- **Developer B**: US3 + US4 (maintenance + today)
- **Developer C**: US5 + US6 (awaiting/completed + inspections)

---

## Notes

- `GET /api/v1/employee/kpis` is subset alias; primary contract is `/employee/dashboard`
- KPI `pendingInspections` extends original api-spec (housekeeping + maintenance only)
- All queries scoped via FR-20 `employee_property_assignments`
- Timezone `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` for all "today" filters
- SCR-60/61/62 routes may 404 until FR-21/13/23 implemented — action cards still navigate
- No audit log for read-only dashboard v1
